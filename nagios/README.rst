    check_cdap_program -u http://my.cdap.router.endpoint:11015 -n mynamespace -f MyApp.MyFlow \\
    -s MyApp.MyService1,MyApp.MyService2

  Check that a flow is running, using environment variables:
    CHECK_CDAP_URI=http://my.cdap.router.endpoint:11015 \\
    CHECK_CDAP_FLOWS=MyApp.MyFlow \\
    check_cdap_program
